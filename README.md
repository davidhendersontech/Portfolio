## What I learned

	Styling has always been the most difficult aspect of web design for me. So This project week I took the time to try and learn tailwindcss. The website as it stands right now is not how I dreamed it would look but I learned so much about tailwind I think the next iteration of the site will be beautiful. I also learned that I really like tailwinds M.O. It gives you smaller tools to create your own components instead of just giving you a button component. But it also offers a way to make your own set of styles (components) and even overide tailwinds default styling. I want to keep working on this project and get my auth to work completely and add an easy way for me to add blogposts from the website.
